# Ionic Framework build provider for Atom

This is a simple build service provider for Atom to be used with Ionic Framework projects.

**Currently supported tasks:**

* Running apps on physical device or emulator (run, emulate)
* Serve apps in browser (serve)
* Build apps (build)

## Requirements

* Ionic CLI tools (see: [Getting Started](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/))
* atom-build

## Bugs
Please do not post bugs related to Ionic. This is only a build service provider invoking the ionic command and has nothing to do with the working of Ionic itself. Please see the official [Ionic website](http://ionicframework.com/) if you think you've found a bug in Ionic.
